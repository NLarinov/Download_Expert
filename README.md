  Welcome!

This is my school project called Sandy Loader (from association with sandbox, where you can do whatever you want).

It is a web-app (Chrome extension) that downloads all files from website by imitating user actions (clicks on buttons and other interactive elements).

  Here is a description from my project work:

An innovative way to download files, which saves users from a long search for links and buttons on the site page.

Inexperienced users will be able to get the objects they need checked through cloud antivirus, and experienced users will be able to get the required data faster. 
This will save valuable time.

Through a special browser extension, users will be able to get a convenient list of files from the site page in two clicks, which is updated as the next link arrives.

The projected extension will give the user specific verified files obtained by simulating clicks on the interactive parts of the page, which guarantees the receipt of the required file, if it exists and is verified.

The program will perform actions with the site independently of the user (go to other pages, download possibly dangerous files, accept all agreements and notifications). Hence the analogy in the name with the sandbox, where you can safely do whatever you want.

If you are intrested in seing my full work and a video with an example of how the extension works, then go here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16_bOBAqZOwYxeYuF-quADOFAW_-nMqXF?usp=sharing
